# Tic Tac Toe AI Game
This is a simple yet unbeatable Tic Tac Toe AI game, developed using the minimax algorithm. The game is designed to work on both iPhone and iPad devices.

## Game Description
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game, where one player is a human and the other is an AI. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the objective is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Minimax Algorithm
The minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm used for decision making in game theory and artificial intelligence. It is used to determine the optimal move for a player, assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally. In this game, the minimax algorithm is used to determine the best move for the AI player.

## How to Play
Download the game and open it on your iPhone or iPad.
Choose whether you want to be 'X' or 'O'.
Make your move by tapping on the grid.
The AI will make its move automatically.
The game continues until there is a winner or the grid is full.
##Game Rules
The player that gets to play first will get the "X" mark, and the player that gets to play second will get the "O" mark.
Players take turns making moves with Player 1 playing mark "X" and Player 2 playing mark "O".
A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his mark ("X" or "O") and their aim is to create a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with two intensions:
One of the players gets three of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) i.e. that player wins the game.
If no one can create a straight line with their own mark and all the positions on the board are occupied, then the game ends in a draw/tie.
